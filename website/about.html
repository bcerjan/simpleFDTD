    <h1 class="display-2">About simpleFDTD</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations are one of the most
      common methods for numerically simulating the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a>.
      The canonical example is the motion of a string when you wiggle one end
      and hold the other fixed, but in this case we are working with light
      (electromagnetic waves). In particular, the question "If we have a small
      particle in water, about 100 nm across, what color will it be?" arises
      with some regularity. It can be surprisngly difficult to find a reference that
      has your exact geometry, material, and dielectric environment, so this
      code lets you answer that question by running a simple 2-D simulation
      right in your browser. While we make no claims that it produces
      publication-quality results, it should be fairly accurate for a wide
      range of parameters (but we make no guarantees) and should definitely
      be enough to get you started on your research again (or pique your
      curiousity).

    <h1 class="display-2">Technical Notes</h1>
    <p>The simulation here is transverse-electric and polarized along the
      vertical direction (perpendicular to the direction the initial pulse
      travels). The initial pulse is a Ricker wavelet centered at 600 nm, and
      the grid step is 10 nm (uniform in X and Y). The grid is terminated by a
      Berenger split-field PML (coded by Doug Neubauer). The simulation runs
      for 3000 time steps (by default, see <a href="#adaptiveTiming">Adaptive Timing</a>)
      and "running" discrete Fourier-Transforms (DFTs)
      are kept to track the reflected and transmitted electric field strengths.
      Note that while we only run for a
      few thousand timesteps, we assume that this is sufficient time for the
      high-frequency response (that we care about) to decay completely. Under
      this assumption, we then 0-pad our total "running time" to be much longer
      (16,384 steps). That length was picked to be a power of 2 in
      the event that I needed to run a post-processing FFT (which are
      frequently most efficient for powers of 2), but for the implementation of
      a running DFT any number of steps could be used (provided that the fields
      have sufficient time to propogate). The transmission/reflection results
      are normalized to a pre-computed run without a structure, which is why
      you are not allowed to change the total area or number of steps in the
      simulation (and also why only discrete background indices are allowed).
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-4" id="spectra">Reflection and Transmission Spectra</h1>
    <p>One of the major advantages of FDTD methods is that they are able to
       simulate a wide band of frequencies with a single run of the simulation.
       However, the results from such a simulation are, generally speaking,
       meaningless without some way to compare them against what the source
       would have done in the absence of any scattering media in the simulation
       volume. So, we need to normalize our results to account for the behavior
       of the source. For transmission spectra, this is straightforward -- one
       just divides the value of the transmitted flux for a "real" run by that
       of an "empty" run. For reflected spectra, the situation is substantially
       more complicated as interference effects can occur. To account for this,
       one has to subtract off the "empty" fields (not fluxes) from those for a
       "real" run when computing the flux. For a much more thorough description
       of the mathematics invloved, see
       <a href="https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/#transmittancereflectance-spectra">
       this part of the meep documentation</a>.

    <h1 class="display-4" id="adaptiveTiming">Adaptive Timing</h1>
    <p>Adaptive timing means that the simulation won't complete until the field
       has sufficiently decayed. Specifically, it is checking for when the
       absolute value of the field has decayed to one millionth of what the
       maximum input value was. This has the potential to make some simulations
       (e.g. mirrors) complete faster and enables the simulation to keep running
       so that long-lived resonances have a chance to radiate away all of their
       energy. Note that this breaks the progres bar at the bottom, as there is
       no longer any way to know ahead of time how many steps will be required.

    <h1 class="display-4" id="drudeMetals">Metal Dielectric Functions</h1>
    <p>This code uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model">Drude
      model</a> to model the dielectric properties of metals. While it does account
      for loss in the metal, it <i>does not</i> account for interband transitions.
      This means that results for gold and copper below about ~550 nm are not
      to be trusted as the light starts getting absorbed. Similarly, right around
      800 nm aluminum has a transition and so it is not accurate at the very end
      of the reported spectrum.

    <h1 class="display-4" id="bugs">Bugs / Using the Code</h1>
    <p>If you're particularly interested (or frustrated that I
       haven't fixed a bug you found), please stop by the
       <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD">GitHub page</a>
       to see how it all fits together. The simulation itself is coded in C
       and has been ported to a browser-compatible format using
       <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> to convert to
       <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>.

    <p>If you'd like to use this code to embed a simulation on your site, please
      do! So long as you respect the (fairly permissive)
      <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">license</a>
      and link people back to the GitHub,
      feel free to use the code as you like.

    <h1 class="display-3">Appreciation</h1>
    <p>This simulation leans heavily on previous work. In particular, I
      appreciate the work by
      <a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/"> John B. Schneider</a>
      and <a href="https://dougneubauer.com/fdtd/">Doug Neubauer</a> who
      provided sufficient online resources for an experimental physicist to
      cobble together a functioning FDTD simulation. If you're interested in learning more about FDTD simulations, I highly
      recommend reading through John's online book and trying to implement
      some of it yourself.
