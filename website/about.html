    <br>
    <p>Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations are one of the most
      common methods for numerically simulating the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a>.
      The canonical example is the motion of a string when you wiggle one end
      and hold the other fixed, but in this case we are working with light
      (electromagnetic waves). In particular, the question "If we have a small
      particle in water, about 100 nm across, what color will it be?" arises
      with some regularity. It can be surprisngly difficult to find a reference that
      has your exact geometry, material, and dielectric environment, so this
      code lets you answer that question by running a simple 2-D simulation
      right in your browser. While we make no claims that it produces
      publication-quality results, it should be fairly accurate for a wide
      range of parameters (but we make no guarantees) and should definitely
      be enough to get you started on your research again (or pique your
      curiousity).

    <h1 class="display-2">Technical Notes</h1>
    <p>The simulation here is transverse-electric and polarized along the
      vertical direction (perpendicular to the direction the initial pulse
      travels). That means that the non-zero field components are:
      \( E_{x}, E_{y}, \) and \( H_{z} \). The timestepping method is a
      leapfrog alternating-direction implicit (LADI) FDTD, as described in
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2018.2878974">this paper by
      Prokopidis and Zografopoulos</a>. The grid is terminated using a Mur
      absorbing boundary condition (ABC) implemented in the LADI FDTD using the
      formulation of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/APCAP.2012.6333119"> Gan
      and Tan</a>. Note that while an ABC is not normally sufficient above 1D,
      it has been demonstrated that in 2D using the LADI methodology, the ABC
      has little to no additional reflection as compared with a traditional PML.
      The major advantage of the (L)ADI method is that we can increase the effective
      speed of light without introducing numberical instabilities and so this simulation uses a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition">
      Courant Number</a> of 1.5.
    </p>
    <p>

      The initial pulse is a hard-source Ricker wavelet of the \(E_{y}\) field
      centered at 600 nm. The grid step is 10 nm (uniform in X and Y). The simulation runs
      for 1300 time steps (by default, see <a href="#adaptiveTiming">Adaptive Timing</a>)
      and "running" discrete Fourier-Transforms (DFTs)
      are kept to track the reflected and transmitted electric field strengths.
      Note that while we only run for a
      thousand timesteps, we assume that this is sufficient time for the
      high-frequency response (that we care about) to decay completely. Under
      this assumption, we then 0-pad our total "running time" to be much longer
      (16,384 steps). That length was picked to be a power of 2 in
      the event that I needed to run a post-processing FFT (which are
      frequently most efficient for powers of 2), but for the implementation of
      a running DFT any number of steps could be used (provided that the fields
      have sufficient time to propogate). The transmission/reflection results
      are normalized to a pre-computed run without a structure, which is why
      you are not allowed to change the total area or number of steps in the
      simulation (and also why only discrete background indices are allowed).
    </p>

    <h1 class="display-4" id="spectra">Reflection and Transmission Spectra</h1>
    <p>One of the major advantages of FDTD methods is that they are able to
       simulate a wide band of frequencies with a single run of the simulation.
       However, the results from such a simulation are, generally speaking,
       meaningless without some way to compare them against what the source
       would have done in the absence of any scattering media in the simulation
       volume. So, we need to normalize our results to account for the behavior
       of the source. For transmission spectra, this is straightforward -- one
       just divides the value of the transmitted flux for a "real" run by that
       of an "empty" run. For reflected spectra, the situation is substantially
       more complicated as interference effects can occur. To account for this,
       one has to subtract off the "empty" fields (not fluxes) from those for a
       "real" run when computing the flux. For a much more thorough description
       of the mathematics invloved, see
       <a href="https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/#transmittancereflectance-spectra">
       this part of the meep documentation</a>.
     </p>

    <br>

    <h1 class="display-4" id="adaptiveTiming">Adaptive Timing</h1>
    <p>Adaptive timing means that the simulation won't complete until the field
       has sufficiently decayed. Specifically, it is checking for when the
       absolute value of the field has decayed to one millionth of what the
       maximum input value was. This has the potential to make some simulations
       (e.g. mirrors) complete faster and enables the simulation to keep running
       so that long-lived resonances have a chance to radiate away all of their
       energy. Note that this breaks the progress bar at the bottom, as there is
       no longer any way to know ahead of time how many steps will be required
       (though it does its best to estimate).

    <h1 class="display-4" id="dielectricFunction">Metal Dielectric Functions</h1>
    <p>This code uses a critical points model for the dielectric function of
      materials. The general form of the dielectric function is:
      $$
         \epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_{\infty} - \frac{\sigma}{i \omega}
          + \sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}} \left[ \frac{c_{p}}{-i \omega - a_{p}} +
           \frac{c_{p}^{*}}{-i \omega - a_{p}^{*}} \right]
          ,
      $$
      where \(\epsilon_{\infty}\) is the infinite-frequency permittivity of the
      material (for metals <i>should</i> be \( 1 \)); \(\sigma\) is the generalized
      static conductivity (in reality it gets divided by \( \epsilon_{0} \), but the
      fitting works better with reasonable-sized numbers);
      and \( c_{p} \) and \( a_{p} \) are the residues and poles, respectively,
      for each critical point in the approximation (with \(N_{p}\) terms). Note
      that for lossless materials or materials described only by a static conductivity,
      \( N_{p} = 0 \) and we ignore the critical points entirely.

    </p>

    <p>
      Physically, each critical point term corresponds to things like interband
      transitions and allows highly complex dielectric functions to be represented.
      Each additional critical point term noticeably slows down the simulation
      (as is evidenced by the difference in speed between Silica and any of the metals).

   </p>
   <p>
     This formulation is among the most general that exist and can accurately
     represent materials that are well-defined by the Drude, Lorentz, or Debye models
     (as well as any other model I've come across).
   </p>

   <p>
     For an example of how to fit your own material data, there is Mathematica
     code for generating the fits
     <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD/tree/master/material_data">
     here</a>. It is important that you fit the real and imaginary parts of
     the data simultaneously as well as employ the heuristic constraints
     \( \epsilon_{\infty} \ge 1 \) and \( \sigma \ge 0 \). Finally, note
     that poor material fits can make the simulation unstable (it makes for
     very nice images, but very poor science). Generally I've found the above
     restrictions to produce stable fits, but there is not a mathematical proof
     of that fact.

       haven't fixed a bug you found), please stop by the
       <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD">GitHub page</a>
       to see how it all fits together. The simulation itself is coded in C
       and has been ported to a browser-compatible format using

    <h1 class="display-3">Appreciation</h1>
    <p>This simulation leans heavily on previous work. In particular, I
      appreciate the work by
      <a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/"> John B. Schneider</a>
      and <a href="https://dougneubauer.com/fdtd/">Doug Neubauer</a> who
      provided sufficient online resources for an experimental physicist to
      cobble together a functioning FDTD simulation. If you're interested in learning more about FDTD simulations, I highly
      recommend reading through John's online book and trying to implement
      some of it yourself.
