    <h1 class="display-2">About simpleFDTD</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations are one of the most
      common methods for numerically simulating the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a>.
      The canonical example is the motion of a string when you wiggle one end
      and hold the other fixed, but in this case we are working with light
      (electromagnetic waves). In particular, the question "If we have a small
      particle in water, about 100 nm across, what color will it be?" arises
      with some regularity. It can be annoying to try to find a reference that
      has your exact geometry, material, and dielectric environment, so this
      code lets you answer that question by running a simple 2-D simulation
      right in your browser. While we make no claims that it produces
      publication-quality results, it should be fairly accurate for a wide
      range of parameters (but we make no guarantees) and should definitely
      be enough to get you started on your research again.

    <p>The simulation here is transverse-electric and polarized along the
      vertical direction (perpendicular to the direction the initial pulse
      travels). The initial pulse is a Ricker wavelet centered at 600 nm, and
      the grid step is 10 nm (uniform in X and Y). The grid is terminated by a
      Berenger split-field PML (coded by Doug Neubauer). The simulation runs
      for 2048 time steps and "running" discrete Fourier-Transforms (DFTs)
      are kept to track the reflected and transmitted electric field strengths.
      Note that while we only run for a
      few thousand timesteps, we assume that this is sufficient time for the
      high-frequency response (that we care about) to decay completely. Under
      this assumption, we then 0-pad our total "running time" to be much longer
      (16,384 steps). Both of those lengths were picked to be powers of 2 in
      the event that I needed to run a post-processing FFT (which are
      frequently most efficient for powers of 2), but for the implementation of
      a running DFT any number of steps could be used (provided that the fields
      have sufficient time to propogate).

    <p>If you're particularly interested (or angry that I
       haven't fixed a bug you found), please stop by the
       <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD">GitHub page</a>
       to see how it all fits together. The simulation itself is coded in C
       and has been ported to a browser-compatible format using
       <a href="emscript.com">emscripten</a> to convert to
       <a href="webassebmly">WebAssembly</a>.
    </p>
    <p>This simulation leans heavily on previous work. In particular, I
      appreciate the work by
      <a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/"> John B. Schneider</a>
      and <a href="https://dougneubauer.com/fdtd/">Doug Neubauer</a> who
      provided sufficient online resources for an experimental physicist to
      cobble together a functioning FDTD simulation. If you're interested in learning more about FDTD simulations, I highly
      recommend reading through John's online book and trying to implement
      some of it yourself. If you're particularly motivated (or angry that I
      haven't fixed a bug you found), please stop by the
      <a href="https://github.com/bcerjan/simpleFDTD">GitHub page</a>
      to fix my errors.
