/** Static definition of our material data to clean up grid initialization and
    make it easier to add new materials

    This data was taken from the source (typically via refractiveindex.info),
    truncated to the range we are getting results for (400-800 nm), and
    then fit with the critical-points model (simultaneously for Re and Im components):
      Ï‡[f] = 	Sum[ Ap * Omegap * (exp[-i*phip]/(Omegap + f - i*Gammap) + exp[i*phip]/(Omegap - f + i*Gammap))

      (see Prokopidis and Dimitrios eq. 1 with no Drude term {it has been folded in
      to the other critical point terms, which wastes some memory, but simplifies
      the coding})

    Note that some of the fits are actually quite poor! This is just a rough
    idea of what a particular metal will do and is not a great substitute for
    a more elaborate simulation.

    Order is: epsilon infinity, conductivity, permeability, resistivity,
    plasma frequency, damping rate: (eps, sigma, mu, sim, f_p, g)
    values in meters, Hz - type units (not radians)

   Current list of materials: 0 -> Al, 1 -> Au, 2 -> Ag, 3 -> Cu, 4 -> Silica
